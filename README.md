# Building a Movie Recommendation System

## The Motivation

The motivation for this project was to compare the effectiveness of some of the traditional approaches used in e-commerce for making personalised recommendations to online users. I was also keen to develop more of an understanding of how these systems are implemented at scale by getting some hands on experience with a distributed computing framework, such as Apache Spark.

## Data Collection

## Data Cleaning

## EDA

Upon exploring the data, I discovered that:

- Users were generally more inclined to give positive reviews. <br/><br/>

- The most popular movies were generally rated amongst the top 5% of all movies. <br/><br/>

- The most active users were generally more critical than the average user. <br/><br/>
